            I love math, and I love some good use of math in my programs. I am definitely not afraid of some challenging functionality. 
            Ever since I first started coding I was just comming up with funky math problems to solve using my extremely little coding knowledge. Great memories, but don't worry I've grown a lot since then

            The past few years I've worked on several projects for my study, ranging from simple C# console applications to software for large businesses. 
            During this time I've worked with several different languages and design principals that have greatly improved my overall capabilities

            Of course I'm still very much eager to continue my journey and learn new exciting things along the way.
